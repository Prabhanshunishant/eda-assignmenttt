        "Most Important Factors Affecting Selling Price\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis revealed that the bike's selling price is primarily affected by a few key factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Year: The year of the bike has a strong positive correlation with the selling price. A newer bike is generally more expensive than an older one. This makes intuitive sense as newer models typically have better features, are in better condition, and are more in demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. KM Driven: The km_driven has a negative correlation with the selling price. Bikes that have been driven less are typically sold at a higher price, as lower mileage suggests less wear and tear and a longer lifespan.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Owner: The number of previous owners is a significant factor. Bikes with only one owner (1st owner) tend to have a higher average selling price compared to those with multiple owners.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Seller Type: The type of seller also influences the price. Bikes sold by a Dealer or Trustmark Dealer have a higher average selling price than those sold by an Individual seller. This might be due to dealers offering certifications, warranties, and a more professional service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Before the analysis, the raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and prepare it for potential modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Outlier Handling: The km_driven column contained outliers, which were identified and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. This step prevented extreme values from skewing the analysis and subsequent model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Engineering: The categorical column seller_type was converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding. This process created new binary columns for each category (e.g., seller_type_Dealer), which is a necessary step to make the data compatible with most machine learning algorithms.\n",
